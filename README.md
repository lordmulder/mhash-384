MHash-384
% Simple fast portable secure hashing library

# Introduction

**MHash-384** is a fast, portable and secure hashing library, released under the *MIT license*.

The MHash-384 core library has been written in plain **C**, and the CLI front-end has been written in **C++**. The core library provides a simple "stream processing" API, that is available in two flavors: a plain C99 version and an *object-oriented* C++ wrapper. Either way, the MHash-384 library produces hash values with a fixed length of 384 bits (48 bytes).

MHash-384 supports a wide range of compilers, including MSVC++, GCC (MinGW/Cygwin), Clang/LLVM and Intel C++. It also runs on many platforms, including Windows and Linux. Furthermore, the MHash-384 library has already been *ported* to various other programming languages, including **Microsoft.NET**, **Java**, **Delphi** and **Free Pascal** as well as **Python**.


# Quick Start Guide

In order to use the *MHash-384* library, simply include the header file `mhash384.h` in your code:

	#include <mhash384.h>

## Example for C language

If you source code is written in **C**, use the **`mhash384_t`** struct and the **`mhash384_XYZ()`** functions:

	/*variables*/
	uint8_t buffer[BUFFSIZE];
	size_t len;
	uint8_t result[MHASH384_SIZE];
	mhash384_t mhash384;
	
	/*initialization*/
	mhash384_init(&mhash384);
	
	/*input data processing*/
	while(more_data())
	{
		len = read_data(buffer, BUFFSIZE);
		mhash384_update(&mhash384, buffer, len);
	}
	
	/*finalization*/
	mhash384_final(&mhash384, result);

## Example for C++ language

Or, if you source code is written in **C++**, use the provided **`MHash384`** wrapper class:

	/*instance*/
	MHash384 mhash384;
	
	/*input data processing*/
	while(more_data())
	{
		const std::vector<uint8_t> buffer = read_data();
		mhash384.update(buffer);
	}
	
	/*finalization*/
	const uint8_t *result = mhash384.finish();
